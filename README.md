## Scripts

All the different build steps are orchestrated via [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).
Npm scripts basically allow us to call (and chain) terminal commands via npm.

| Npm Script | Description                                                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start`    | Runs node on dist/index.js. Can be invoked with `npm start` |
| `build`    | Runs full build. Can be invoked with `npm build`            |
| `dev`      | Runs develop mode. Can be invoked with `npm dev`            |
| `test`     | Runs build and run tests using jest                         |
| `lint`     | Runs TSLint on project files                                |
